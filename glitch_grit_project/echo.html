        <p style="color:#000d6d;">Aesthetic failure is a form of self-expression in art. It can be expressing emotions such as vulnerability. It could be a way to express how artists feel as if they cannot achieve their vision. Rather than let that feeling of failure win, artists use that failure as an aesthetic. They embrace it and express that feeling of failure in their art. Sometimes this aesthetic failure could be intentional. Whether it came by chance or was intentional, artists embrace it and use it to express that vulnerability in their art.<p/>
